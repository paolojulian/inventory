# Enterprise Go Inventory System - Tech Stack Overview

## ✅ Your Final Tech Stack

### 🧠 Architecture

- **Clean Architecture / DDD**: Domain-driven design with layered architecture
- **TDD-first**: Testing-first development (no Postman/Swagger)
- **Modular Package Structure**:

  - `domain/` - domain layer, entities an stuff
  - `usecase/` - business logics/application layet
  - `interfaces/` - endpoints like rest/gql(in the future)
  - `infrastructure/` - things like databases and repositories
  - `config/` - constants like env files
  - `tests/` - e2e tests

✅ Refined MVP Breakdown

🏠 Home (Dashboard)

The quick-glance health view of your inventory.

Keep these two — perfect indicators:
• ✅ Show Low stock / Out of stock
• ✅ Show Near expiry / Expired

Suggestion:
• Keep it simple → 4 boxes or list summaries.
• Add “View All” links that go to filtered Inventory pages.

⸻

📦 Stock Entry

This is the core of inventory movement (ledger of changes).

Perfect MVP scope:
• ✅ Add / Remove Stock
• Optional: Reason selector (restock, sale, damage, adjustment)
• ✅ Fields:
• Expiry Date (for perishable items)
• Supplier Price (optional, internal data)
• Store Price (public retail price)
• Reorder Date (for reminders)

Optional for later (not MVP-critical):
• Supplier info
• Multiple batch tracking

⸻

🧾 Inventory

The live snapshot of all quantities.

Excellent MVP goals:
• ✅ List all product stocks
• ✅ Show count (quantity)
• ✅ Visual statuses:
• 🟠 Low stock
• 🔴 Out of stock
• 🟠 Near expiry
• 🔴 Expired

Recommendation:
• Let user filter/sort by:
• Category
• Stock status
• Expiry date

⸻

🧺 Products

The catalog of what you track.

MVP-perfect as written:
• ✅ List of products
• ✅ Add / Edit / Delete product

Optional later:
• Product categories
• Variants (sizes, colors, etc.)
• Product images

⸻

💡 MVP Flow Summary

Step User Action System Response
1 Add Product Creates product entry
2 Add Stock Entry Updates stock + records history
3 Dashboard Shows low/out-of-stock alerts
4 Inventory Lists all products with stock counts & statuses

⸻

🚀 You can go live with this

If you build just this, you already have a real operational tool for:
• Small retail shops
• Cafes or bakeries
• Pharmacies or groceries
• Hardware stores

⸻

Would you like me to draw the screen flow wireframe next (Home → Inventory → Product → Stock Entry)?
It’ll help visualize how users move through this MVP.
